			<h2>Power</h2>
			
			
			<h3>Geothermal</h3>
			
			<p>Geothermal power uses natural heat from the Earth to create energy.<br><br>
				In a geothermal power plant, natural heat from the Earth is used to boil water or any other similar fluid.
				The water then rises as steam and spins a turbine.
				The turbine then generates energy.<br><br>
				Dry Steam Power Stations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Simplest and oldest design</li>
				<li>Not used often because it requires a source of dry steam</li>
				<li>But it is the most efficient with the simplest facilities</li>
				<li>Dry steam is typically produced by naturally occurring geothermal geysers</li>
				<li>Dry Steam Power uses geothermal steam of 150°C or greater to turn turbines</li>
				<li>The turbine produces electricity</li>
				<li>Then the used steam is sent to a condenser and becomes liquid water</li>
				<li>The water is piped back to the source of the steam to be heated again</li>
			</ul>
			<p><br>Flash Steam Power Stations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Most common type of geothermal power station in operation today</li>
				<li>Pull deep, high-pressure water into lower-pressure tanks</li>
				<li>Use the resulting flashed steam to drive turbines</li>
				<li>They require fluid temperatures of at least 180°C, usually more</li>
				<li>Use geothermal reservoirs of water with temperatures greater than 182°C</li>
				<li>Hot water flows up out of wells in the ground under its own pressure</li>
				<li>As it flows upward, the pressure decreases and some of the hot water boils into steam</li>
				<li>The steam is separated from the water and used to turn a turbine</li>
				<li>Any leftover water and condensed steam can be injected back into the reservoir, making this a potentially sustainable resource</li>
			</ul>
			<p><br>Binary Cycle Power Station:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The most recent development in geothermal power</li>
				<li>Can accept fluid temperatures as low as 57°C</li>
				<li>Moderately hot geothermal water is passed by a secondary fluid with a boiling point much lower than water</li>
				<li>This causes the secondary fluid to flash vaporize and drive the turbines</li>
				<li>This is the most common type of geothermal power station being constructed today</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3><br>Geothermal Heat</h3>
			
			<p>Another application of geothermal power is using geothermal water to heat homes. 
				Water is piped down into the ground, where it is geothermally heated. 
				The water is then sent into the house and is circulated via pipes in the walls. 
				As the geothermal water travels through the pipes, it radiates its heat into the rooms. 
				Once the water has cooled, it is sent back into the ground, and the cycle starts again.<br><br>
				Geothermal heat can also be integrated into existing heating systems in a house. 
				It typically costs between $20,000 and $25,000 to install. 
				A professional must be hired to install it.</p>
			
			
			<h3><br>Wind Energy</h3>
			
			<p>Wind Energy is one of the cleanest forms of energy as it does not make any pollutants and emissions (other than ones for maintenance.) 
				Placing multiple wind turbines next to each other creates a massive amount of electricity. 
				A benefit of wind energy is that it follows the energy law, “Energy is never destroyed, rather it is transferred into another form of energy.” Wind in one of the first forms of energy, used all the way back in 2000 B.C. 
				It was used by the Persians and Chinese for anything on land like pumping water for grain and sailing on the Pacific Ocean. 
				The largest turbines can power up to 600 homes each which can be really beneficial in city areas.<br><br>
				Wind Turbines:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>As high as 20-story buildings</li>
				<li>Have 60 foot “plane” like propellers that rotate</li>
				<li>Spin to produce energy</li>
				<li>Can be set up offshore and bring energy back to land</li>
			</ul>
			<p><br>Wind turbines can offset up to 2,600 pound of carbon dioxide. 
				Wind energy makes up more than 25% of the energy in some countries. 
				Wind energy is one of the only types of energy that don’t use water, thus it will save 30 trillion bottles of water.</p>
			
			
			<h2><br>Solar Panels</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Use light (usually sunlight) to produce energy</li>
				<li>Made up of photovoltaic cells which use the photovoltaic effect.</li>
				<li>Photovoltaic effect: when light hits certain materials, it excites electrons in the material, creating electricity.</li>
				<li>Photovoltaic cells are delicate, so they must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture.</li>
				<li>The photovoltaic cells are arranged in a grid pattern within a module, and the modules are arranged in a grid pattern within a solar panel.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><br>Types of photovoltaic cells:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Conventional: rigid and made primarily of crystalline silicon.</li>
				<li>Thin film: flexible and consists of a substrate (glass, plastic, metal, etc) coated with photovoltaic material.</li>
				<li>Multi-junction:</li>
				<li>Multiple thin film cells are laid on top of one another.</li>
				<li>Each layer is tuned to a different segment of the electromagnetic spectrum.</li>
				<li>This allows each layer to absorb the type of electromagnetic radiation it is tuned to.</li>
				<li>As such, multi-junction cells are much more efficient than single-junction cells.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><br>How solar panels work:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Photons in sunlight hit the solar panel and are absorbed by semiconducting materials, such as silicon.</li>
				<li>Electrons are excited from their current molecular/atomic orbital.</li>
				<li>Once excited, an electron can either dissipate the energy as heat and return to its orbital, or it can travel through the cell to the electrode.</li>
				<li>An array of solar cells convert solar energy into a usable amount of direct current (DC) electricity.</li>
				<li>An inverter can be used to convert the power to alternating current (AC).</li>
