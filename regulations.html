			<h3>Challenges with Zoning</h3>
			
			<p>Zoning is dividing up land into sections which can or cannot be used. Zoning can be good but has a lot of challenges.</p>
			<p><br>The first challenge with zoning is community opposition. Before you can zone you have to have a public hearing and chances are that there will be people who oppose what you propose.</p>
			<p><br>“Depending on the scope of a project, the zoning/planning board may require a specially advertised public hearing on a project for either the initial presentation or subsequent hearings.</p>
			<p><br>When neighboring property owners have objections to the rezoning of your parcel of land, they’ll have the opportunity to offer their comments and concerns during these hearings and before the zoning commission makes its decision. This feedback can typically lead to lost time and added costs for a project” (blog.simoncre.com).</p>
			<p><br>Another thing you need to consider is Compliance. There are plenty of regulations and codes you must follow before you do anything. “Zoning codes and building codes serve different purposes, yet they are closely related. Local planning and zoning hearings often mandate that any zoning or use change will only be authorized if the subject parcel is brought into full compliance with existing building code statutes” (blog.simoncre.com).</p>
			<p><br>Current criteria must also be met by certain site improvements as well, including:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Landscaping</li>
				<li>Water retention</li>
				<li>Parking requirements</li>
			</ul>
			<p><br>Having plans presented is also a must have with zoning. “In general, a property owner has a better chance of approval when the rezoning request is consistent with the long-range general plan of the municipality. Municipality general plans provide a foundation for zoning but should also allow for flexibility of future conditions and ideas.</p>
			<p><br>Issues that often arise may occur when there is an error in the original zoning for the property, or when changes have occurred which prevent use of his land as originally zoned. Extensive arguments/justifications need to be presented in order for municipalities to revise the general plan and/or approve rezoned property” (blog.simoncre.com).</p>
			<p><br>Another important thing is improvements. “Zoning/planning boards typically want to approve development projects that include off-site improvements that create infrastructure improvements to the community. The creation of needed new roads, sewer systems, landscaping, and donations of land to be used for other community projects are often considered the developer's cost of doing business in the community.</p>
			<p><br>Probably one of the biggest factors is time frame. “Depending on municipal requirements, it may take up to three months to get on a zoning/planning board's agenda. As previously mentioned, the board may require special public hearings on particular projects, a phase that can draw out the length of the rezoning process.</p>
			<p><br>Additionally, controversial projects that face greater community opposition are often tabled to allow for greater community input, and often see multiple hearings.</p>
			<p><br>When approaching zoning regulations, the key is to know what the requirements are prior to embarking on your business plan. This better prepares all involved parties for the challenges of zoning regulations, how to handle them, and hopefully ensures your commercial real estate development project is suited to meet those requirements” (blog.simoncre.com).</p>
			<p><br>In all zoning is very challenging, one mistake could get you denied.</p>
			<p><br>So in making bioshelters we need to understand that a lot plays into making this possible and how to overcome the challenges so that bioshelters or places for energy harvesting for solar, wind and geothermal can be approved and placed.</p>
