			<h3>Earth Bioshelters</h3>
			
			<p>Earth Bioshelters or “Earthships” are passive solar houses made of either natural or recycled materials. They are meant to work autonomously which means they don’t rely on things such as power, gas etc, and they also include a natural ventilation system. “The original Earthships' designs were at first very experimental, but with practice and evolution the houses began looking attractive” (environment-ecology.com). These houses were designed to work off of available resources for example, they use windows to bring in light rather than using electricity. A common material for the interior walls is honey comb. The website also stated that most Earthships have insulated roofs. The exterior walls were mainly made of recycled tires with stucco (a type of plaster). How do they get these tires? “There are an estimated 2 billion tires throughout the United States. As of 1996, as many as 253 million scrap tires were being generated each year in the United States, with 70% being reclaimed by the scrap tire market (leaving perhaps 75 million scrap tires available for reuse as whole tires). In addition to the availability of scrap tires, the method by which they are converted into usable ‘bricks’, the ramming of the earth, is simple and affordable” (environment-ecology.com).</p>
			<p><br><br>“One of the greatest draws of the Earthship home is the ability to sustain comfortable temperatures all year round. From freezing-cold temperatures to blistering climates, Earthships hover around 70 degrees Fahrenheit year round. This is due to the solar heat being absorbed and stored in thermal mass (tires filled with dirt), which is the basis of the Earthship structure. The thermal mass operates as a heat sink absorbing heat when the interior cools and insulating when the interior needs warmth. The greenhouse windows at the front of the home face south, allowing the sun to heat the thermal mass during the daytime” (architizer.com). These houses also include modern amenities. You can also grow your own food and be free of financial burden. You also have the ability to recycle water, house construction is also very easy and simple.</p>
